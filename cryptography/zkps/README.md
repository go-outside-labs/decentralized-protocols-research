### tl; dr



* **zero-knowledge proofs** represent **programs as circuits**, where a **prover** generates a proof from public and private inputs, and a **verifier** computes that the output if the statement is correct (without any information regarding the private input).


* three fundamental characteristics define a ZKP:
  * completeness (if a statement is true, then an honest verifier can be convinced by an honest prover that they possess knowledge about the correct input),
  * soundness (if a statement is false, then no dishonest prover can unilaterally convince an honest verifier that they have knowledge about the correct input), and
  * zero-knowledge (if the state is true, then the verifier learns nothing more from the prover other than that).

* zk proofs use cases:
  * **private transactions**: blockchains such as zcash, with privacy-preserving txs.
  * **verifiable computations**: decentralized oracle networks, providing smart contracts with access to off-chain data.
  * **highly-scalable and secure l2s**: verifiable computations through methods such as zk-rollups, validiums, and volition by they use l1s as a settlement layer.
  * **decentralized identity and authentication**: zkps can underpin identity management systems to enable users to validate their identity.
