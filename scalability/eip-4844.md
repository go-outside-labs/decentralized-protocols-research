## eip-4844

<br>

### tl; dr

<br>

* [eip-4844: shard blob transactions](https://www.eip4844.com/) introduces a new kind of tx type, that accepts "blobs" of data to be persisted in the beacon node for a short period of time. blobs are small enough to keep disk use manageable.
* this eip is designed for rollups to further reduce the cost of data submission and verification
* part of eip-4844 involves using kzg commitments (generate seeds [here](https://ceremony.ethereum.org/#/lobby))
