## eip 4844

<br>

### tl; dr

<br>

* first interation of sharding design of ethereum - a way to have more data through the network.
* eip-4844 creates a cheap palce for l2 solutions to post data on ethereum and reduce overall tx fees users pay on l2. a new tx format for "blob-carrying txs" (large amount of data that cannot be accessed by evm execution, but which commitment can).
* zk rollups would need to provide 2 commitments: the kzg in the blob and some commitment using zkp syste. they would prove that the kzg and the zk rollup commitment refer to the same data.
