## zk proofs applied to ml

<br>

### ideas

* model authenticity
  - assurance that the ml model is the one that run (e.g. the most accurate one)
  - functional commitments allow the prover to establosj that it used a commited model (but no guarantess about the commited model).

* model integrity
  - assurance that the same ml algorithm is ran on different data the same way


* attestations  
  - integrate attestations from external parties
  
 * decentralized inference or traning
  - perform ml training in a decentralized way 
 
 * proof of personhood
