## zk-STARKS

<br>

### tl; dr

<br>

* the T stands for "transparent", resolving one fo the primary weakness of zk-snarks, its reliance on a trusted setup.
* thye also come with much simpler cryptographic assumptions, avoiding the need for elliptic curves, pairings, and knowledge of expoent assumptions - instead relying on hashes and information theory (secure on the quantum standard).
* the size of a proof goes up from 288 bytes to a few hundred kilobytes.
