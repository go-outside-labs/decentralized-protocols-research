## ðŸ’Ž modern zkp proving systems

<br>

### tl; dr

<br>

* zk proofs represent programas as circuits where a prover generates a proof from public and private inputs, and the verifier computes that the output if the statement is correct (without any information regarding the private input).



<br>

### zkp use cases

<br>

* **private transactions**
  - blockchains such as zcash, with privacy-preserving txs
  
* **verifiable computations**
  - decentralized oracle networks, providing smart contracts with access to off-chain data
  
* **highly-scalable and secure l2s**
  - verifiable computations through methods such as zk-rollups, validiums, and volition by they use l1s as a settlement layer
  
* **decentralized identity and authentication**
  - zkps can underpin identity management systems to enable users to validate their identity
