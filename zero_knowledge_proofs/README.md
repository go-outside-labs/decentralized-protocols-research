## ðŸ’Ž modern zk proving systems

<br>

### tl; dr

<br>

* **zero-knowledge proofs** represent **programs as circuits**, where a **prover** generates a proof from public and private inputs, and a **verifier** computes that the output if the statement is correct (without any information regarding the private input).
* refer to "succinct proofs" instead of "zero-knowledge proofs" when the zero-knowledge property is not present.
* zk proofs use cases:
  * **private transactions**: blockchains such as zcash, with privacy-preserving txs.
  * **verifiable computations**: decentralized oracle networks, providing smart contracts with access to off-chain data.
  * **highly-scalable and secure l2s**: verifiable computations through methods such as zk-rollups, validiums, and volition by they use l1s as a settlement layer.
  * **decentralized identity and authentication**: zkps can underpin identity management systems to enable users to validate their identity.
