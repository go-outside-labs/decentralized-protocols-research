## zkEVM

<br>

### tl; dr

<br>

* with zk proofs, zk-rollup can achieve better scalability, security, and faster finality as a scaling solution for ethereum.
* zkEVM is a scaling solution compatible with ethereum. other solutions such as zksync lite, loopring, and starknet were not evm-compatible.
* example: the bundling of txs happening within a certain period and settling the proof of a block of txs on the ethereum network instead of the full list of tx that may congest the network.
