### the knapsack problem

<br>

* in the knapsack problem, you need to pack a set of items, with given values and sizes (such as weights or volumes), into a container with a maximum capacity.
* if the total size of the items exceeds the capacity, you can't pack them all. 
in that case, the problem is to choose a subset of the items of maximum total value that will fit in the container.
